use the command to install libraries 

pip install -r requirements.txt

run the setup.py for initial setup... This must be done only once

run the run_automation.py for the rest of the functionality

make sure to setup your .env {the initial setup is given in a txt file... you just have to enter your apis and credentials and rename the file}
